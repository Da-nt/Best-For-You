                <p>The main version of the Nintendo Switch is getting up there in age but would still hold up pretty well, and for the price it would go for these days, it wouldn't be a bad bargain.</p>
            
                <p>The Oled version of the Nintendo Switch is the latest variant of it and it boasts better sound quality, more internal space and a 7 inch OLED screen for only around 50$ more than the orginal  one.</p>
